# Seq-RNA
In the work entitled "Machine Learning Assisted Direct RNA Sequencing with Epigenetic RNA Modifications Detection via Quantum Tunneling,"  we have developed a machine-learning tool for the identification of four natural and two modified RNA Nucleotides from their pooled transmission dataset obtained from DFT-NEGF calculations using a quantum tunneling approach.
